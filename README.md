# Sorting-Searching-Algorithms

### What's this about? 

Hello there :wave:, anyone those are new to Computer Science and just started with Data structures and algorithms, are on the right place:ok_hand:. If they want to get started eith Git, GitHub or OpenSource Contributions. In the issues section, they can pick up one issue which directs them to make the same sorting and searching algorithms in different programming languages:open_mouth:. The algorithms are already been created using C++ for logic reference, you can refer to it and implement the programming languages which most interests you.:nerd_face:

Actually, this is an initiative to promote Open-Source among the newbies:triumph:, anyone who wants to get started with Git, GitHub or OpenSource contributions:cowboy_hat_face:.

**<div align="center">`Simple Steps : Pick the issue which most interests you, even if that issuse is taken, you're good to go! Make Sure you strictly follow this below instructions to have your contributions to be considered!`**</div>

### General Instructions :mega:

1. Choose and pick the issue which most interests you:heavy_check_mark:.
2. You can even create issue which I've not created for any other language you want to work on:heavy_check_mark:.
3. Fork this repository:heavy_check_mark:.
4. You can create a folder with name : `Algorithms in <programming-language-name>`:heavy_check_mark:.
5. You have to add the same algorithms which have been already created in folder `Algorithms in C++`:heavy_check_mark:.
6. The algorithmic programs should have the same name as of having in `Algorithms in C++` directory:heavy_check_mark:.
7. These program's name should only differ in extensions for instance : `.java`, `.CS`, `.py` etc :heavy_check_mark:.
8. Open Up a pull request after a review, I'll merge if it has no conflicts:heavy_check_mark:.
7. **`NOTE`** Please implement User input on all algorithms instead of hard coded values:heavy_check_mark:.
